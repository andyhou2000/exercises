# Programming Exercise 2-6
#
# Program to calculate a total sale price using state and local sales tax.
# This program prompts a user for an amount of purchase,
# uses constants to calculate state, county and total sales tax, and a purchase total
# then displays the details of these calculations for the user.

# Variables for purchase amount, state tax, county tax, total tax and total sale
# all initialized as floats


# Constants for the state and county tax rates


# Get the amount of purchase from the user, casting it to a float.


# Calculate the state sales tax.


# Calculate the county sales tax.


# Sum the total tax.


# Calculate the total of the sale.


# Print detailed information about the sale, formatting all values to two decimal places.

price = input("Input price of purchase: ")
price = float(price)

stateTax = .06
stateTax = float(stateTax)

countyTax = .01
countyTax = float(countyTax)

total = price * (1 + stateTax) * (1 + countyTax)

print("Total price is: $%.2f"%total)
