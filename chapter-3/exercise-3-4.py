# Programming Exercise 3-4
#
# Program to convert a number from 1 to 10 to a Roman numeral.
# This program will accept an integer from 1 to 10 from the user
# and use it to choose an appropriate Roman numeral
# to display on the screen.

# Variables to hold a number and a numeral.
# initialize the number as an int and the numeral as a string.

# Get number from user and convert it to an int


# Set numeral to a Roman numeral value based on the value of number
# use a set of if ... elif .... etc. statements.

Num = input("Input an interger between 1 and 10: ")
Num = int(Num)

if Num == 1:
    print("I")
elif Num == 2:
    print("II")
elif Num == 3:
    print("III")
elif Num == 4:
    print("IV")
elif Num == 5:
    print("V")
elif Num == 6:
    print("VI")
elif Num == 7:
    print("VII")
elif Num == 8:
    print("VIII")
elif Num == 9:
    print("IX")
elif Num == 10:
    print("X")
else:
    print("That's out of range.")




# use a final else to display an error if number is out of range.


# display the numeral on the screen.
